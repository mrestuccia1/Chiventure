/*
 * This example program runs a full instance of chiventure with an in-memory
 * game. The CLI is monkey-patched to accept functions that serve to showcase
 * the movement and battle functionalities of the NPC, which unfortunately, we
 * didn't have time to integrate with the UI/CLI.
 *
 *  - ATTACK: This is a CLI operation that allows the player to attack all of
 *            the npcs present in a room at once. It removes 1 point of HP from
 *            every npc whose health is greater than their surrender level. If
 *            an npc is killed i.e. it's health is 0, then the player is
 *            informed that they can pick up the npc's items. If an npc
 *            surrenders, i.e. it's health is less than or equal to it's
 *            surrender level, then the player attacking will not remove that
 *            npc's health, and the player will be informed that the npc has
 *            surrendered. While this exact functionality (attacking all npcs
 *            at once) probably won't be added to chiventure, it showcases
 *            how we hope the surrender and dead-npc-looting and dead npc
 *            looting functionalities can be used in battles in the future.
 *
 *  - NPC:    This is a CLI operation that prints out all the NPCs in the
 *            current room to the CLI. It utilizes the backend of rooms_npc
 *            module while printing to chiventure's CLI. Specifically, it uses
 *            a field in the room_t struct called npcs, which contains a list
 *            of NPCs in the current room and the total number of them. For
 *            deatils about this field, see rooms_npc.h.
 *
 *  - ARENA:  This is a CLI operation that moves the player from the lobby to
 *            the arena room. Since the main focus of this example is not player
 *            movement but NPCs movements, there are only two rooms in this example,
 *            which are lobby and arena, and the action of moving between rooms are
 *            simplified with only a call to move_room() under game.h. The process of
 *            building a path between rooms is skipped here since it is not curcial to
 *            the example.
 *
 *  - LOBBY:  Similarly, this is a CLI operation that moves the player from the arena
 *            room back to the lobby after the battle. This operation is essentially
 *            a call to move_room() under game.h with a print statement indicating that
 *            the player is back to the lobby. The process of building a path between rooms
 *            is skipped here since it is not curcial to the example.
